It seems like you're trying to compile a program called "monty" which appears to be a part of a larger project. The errors you've posted indicate several issues in your code that need to be addressed. I'll go through each error message and explain what it means:

1. `error: unknown type name ‘stack_t’`: This error occurs when the compiler encounters the identifier `stack_t`, but it doesn't recognize it as a valid type. It seems like you might have a custom data type named `stack_t`, but it's not defined before it's being used. Make sure you have included the necessary headers or defined the `stack_t` type properly.

2. `error: no semicolon at end of struct or union`: This error typically arises when you define a structure or union in your code but forget to include a semicolon `;` at the end of the definition. Ensure that your structure or union definitions have semicolons at the end.

3. `error: implicit declaration of function ‘dprintf’`: This error indicates that you are trying to use the function `dprintf`, but the compiler doesn't recognize it because you haven't included the necessary header that declares this function. Make sure to include the appropriate header for the functions you are using.

4. `error: implicit declaration of function ‘_split’`: Similar to the previous error, this indicates that the function `_split` is being used without being properly declared or defined before its usage.

5. `error: assignment to ‘char **’ from ‘int’ makes pointer from integer without a cast`: This error suggests that you are assigning an `int` value to a `char **` type, which indicates a mismatched data type assignment.

6. `error: implicit declaration of function ‘_atoi’`: Similar to the previous errors, this error indicates that the `_atoi` function is being used without being declared or defined.

7. `error: excess elements in struct initializer`: This error occurs when you are initializing a structure with more elements than it was declared to have. Double-check your structure initializations and make sure they match the declared structure.

8. `error: ‘instruction_t’ has no member named ‘handler’`: This error indicates that you're trying to access a member named `handler` in a structure of type `instruction_t`, but the `handler` member doesn't exist in that structure.

9. `error: control reaches end of non-void function`: This error suggests that your function is declared to return a non-void type but doesn't have a return statement for all possible control paths.

In general, to resolve these errors, you need to ensure that:

- Necessary headers are included.
- Custom data types and functions are properly declared and defined before usage.
- Structures are defined and initialized correctly.
- Return types of functions match their declarations.
- Semicolons are used appropriately at the end of declarations and statements.

Carefully review each error message and the corresponding code sections to identify the root causes and fix them accordingly.
